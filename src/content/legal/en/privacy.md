# Missale Privacy Policy

**Last updated: 1 October 2026**

This policy describes the Missale app for iPhone and iPad. It was written from
the app's source code rather than from a template: everything the app stores is
listed in `Sources/Models/LocalData.swift`, and an automated test fails if the
app starts storing something that is not in this policy.

## The short version

Missale asks for an account, created with Sign in with Apple. That account is
the only thing the app sends to a server of ours: the identifier Apple gives us
and, if you choose to share it, your email (which may be an Apple relay
address).

**What you write and log stays on your device.** Your notes, the Examen, your
"Today I am…" log, your rosaries and your progress stay only on your iPhone.
**There are two exceptions, and in both the text serves for Jev to choose
something from the reviewed collection (in the guidance, also for Anthropic to
write a short reflection):** the text you write in the "Write
what you are feeling" box leaves the device when, and only when, you tap
"Receive guidance"; and, if you subscribe and personalization is on, some of
what you write (the Rosary intention, the Examen, the morning intention) is
sent to choose what to show. In the onboarding guidance, the answers you gave
to the questionnaire go along with the text. See "The guidance" and
"Personalization" below.

## What is stored on your device

Everything below stays in the app's local storage, on your device.

**What you write and log**

- Your "Today I am…" log: the state you chose, the date, and the optional note
  you type.
- Your written answers in the daily Examen: gratitude, request for light,
  review, and response.
- The rosaries you log, with the mystery, the mode, and the intention when you
  write one.
- Your Formation progress: which parts you completed, and in what order.
- In the Bible, the verses you highlighted and the chapter marked as "where I
  stopped".
- What you completed of "Your day with God" each day (for the last 60 days),
  what you wrote you hope for each day in the Morning Offering, and how far
  you've read in the New Testament.
- The days you completed "Your day with God" (the date only), used to ask for
  an App Store rating once, on the third day.
- The name you type in Settings, used only to greet you by name in the app.

**Your preferences**

- The language you chose for the app.
- The regional liturgical calendar you chose.
- Whether the Rosary's beginner mode is on.
- Whether "Personalize with what I write" is on.
- Whether you have finished the introduction.
- The times you chose for the daily reading notice.

The language setting lives in storage shared between the app and its widgets,
so the widget appears in the same language. That sharing is local, on your
device.

## What the app does not do

- **It does not send what you write**, except the guidance text (in onboarding, along with the questionnaire
  answers), when you ask for it, and the personalization texts, if you subscribe and it is on. We
  keep none of it: notes, the Examen, your log and your progress stay on your
  device.
- **No sync.** Nothing is copied to another device by us.
- **No analytics, telemetry, or third-party trackers.** No analytics,
  advertising, or attribution SDK is included.
- **No ads.**
- **We do not sell, rent, or share data.**
- **No access** to your contacts, calendar, photos, microphone, camera, or
  location.

## Your account

To use Missale you sign in with **Sign in with Apple**. There is no password of
ours: Apple is the one confirming it is you.

**What our server receives and keeps**

- The identifier Apple creates for you in Missale (a code that works in no
  other app).
- Your email, only if you choose to share it on Apple's screen. Apple lets you
  hide your email; in that case we receive a relay address.
- The date the account was created.

**On your device**, the account session (the keys that prove to the server
that you signed in) is kept in the iPhone Keychain, encrypted, on this device
only, outside backups and iCloud.

**Where it lives.** The server runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), in the United
States, which processes this data on our behalf. By creating the account you
agree to this international transfer, made to provide the service you asked
for.

**For how long.** Until you delete the account. We do not use this data for
advertising, do not sell it and do not combine it with anything.

**The app only talks to the Missale server**, and only to sign in, keep the
session, delete the account, and ask for guidance and personalization. Besides that, it downloads
from our file server the app's own texts (saints, the word of the day and
others) when we publish corrections or new content. Nothing of yours is sent
in that download: the app only asks for the files, like any web page. An automated test fails if networking code
appears anywhere else in the app.

## The guidance

In the "Write what you are feeling" box you can describe how you are. When you
tap **"Receive guidance"**:

- The text goes to the Missale server, which passes it to **Jev**, an
  artificial intelligence model by **TypeSafe AI**, through **OpenRouter**
  (both in the United States). Jev writes nothing: it only **chooses**, from
  Missale's reviewed collection, the state the text describes and the reply
  (the Psalm, the saint and the step) that fits it best, and indicates whether
  the text carries a sign of risk to life, so the crisis guidance comes first.
- After Jev chooses, the Missale server sends your text, the Bible passage and
  the saint chosen to **Anthropic, PBC** (the **Claude** model), which writes a
  short reflection from them. Anthropic is a second recipient of the text,
  besides Jev, and its handling follows Anthropic's terms for the API.
  When the text carries a sign of risk to life, the server also tells
  Anthropic so, for the reflection to speak of God and guide you to seek
  support and a priest; in that case the passage and the saint may not go.
- In the onboarding guidance, the answers you gave to the questionnaire (the
  questions about your life and your spiritual life) go along with the text,
  to Jev and to Anthropic, for the same purpose: choosing the passage and the
  saint and writing the reflection. Missale does not keep these answers either.
- **We do not keep the text**, the questionnaire answers or the reflection,
  and none of it goes into the server's logs. The server keeps only how many guidance requests your account
  made each day, for a daily limit, and how many it used without a
  subscription. OpenRouter and TypeSafe process the text and the answers to answer, under their
  own policies.
- On your device, the text is saved as the note of that "Today I am…" entry,
  like any note of yours.
- Because the text may speak of your faith and your emotional health, which are
  sensitive data, it is only sent by your tap on the button, each time, and the
  notice sits right below the box. You can always log how you are with the
  buttons alone, sending nothing.

## Personalization

If you subscribe, Missale can choose, from what you write, what to show at some
moments of the day. This only happens once you allow it: the first time
personalization would send something, a prompt asks whether it can continue,
with a link to this policy; while you don't answer, or if you tap "Not now",
nothing is sent. Tapping "Allow" there, or turning on **"Personalize with what
I write"** in **Settings** (the explanation is right there too), holds until
you change your mind. Turning the switch off only pauses sending; erasing your
data also erases that permission, and it asks again next time. The switch is
on by default, but nothing leaves the device before the permission.

- **What is sent:** the intention you write for the Rosary; your written
  answers in the daily Examen; the morning intention, in the Morning Offering;
  and, for the word of the day, your latest "Today I am…" entry or the latest
  morning intention you wrote.
- **When:** only if you subscribe, personalization is on, and you have already
  allowed it in the prompt. Missing any of those three, none of this leaves
  the device, and the app works as always, without personalizing.
- **What for:** the text goes to the Missale server, which passes it to
  **Jev**, as with the guidance. Jev writes nothing: it only **chooses**, from
  Missale's reviewed collection, what fits what you wrote (for example, the
  Rosary mysteries), and indicates whether the text carries a sign of risk to
  life, so the crisis guidance comes first. What appears this way is always
  labeled as chosen from what you wrote.
- **We do not keep this text**, and it does not go into the server's logs. The
  server keeps only how many choices your account asked for each day, for a
  daily limit. OpenRouter and TypeSafe process the text to answer, under their
  own policies.

## Notifications

If you allow it, the app schedules the Angelus reminders on your iPhone, at
6am, noon, and 6pm. Those reminders are created and fired by the iPhone itself,
from the liturgical calendar that ships inside the app. There is no
notification server, nothing is sent to us, and we do not learn whether you
received, opened, or ignored a reminder. You can withdraw permission at any
time in iPhone Settings.

## Links to sources

Saint records, the Examen, the apparitions, and the readings name the editions
and documents their text came from, and some carry a link. Tapping a link opens
that source's website in your browser — the Holy See, a shrine, a public
archive. From there, that site's privacy policy applies, not this one. The app
sends none of your data through those links.

## Subscription

Missale offers an optional subscription. Purchase, billing, renewal, and
cancellation are handled entirely by the **Apple App Store**. We never see or
store your billing name, card, address, or any payment detail. The app asks the
App Store only whether an active subscription exists on this device, in order
to unlock the corresponding content.

Apple's handling of your payment data is governed by Apple's privacy policy.

## Deleting your data

**Deleting the account**: in **Settings › Account › Delete account**. This
erases from our server everything it keeps about you (the Apple identifier, the
email if any, and the creation date) and ends the session on this device. It
does not cancel a subscription: that belongs to the App Store and is cancelled
there.

**Deleting the app from your device removes everything it saved there** — your
notes, your log, your progress, your name and the session. The account on the
server remains until you delete it, in the app or by writing to the contact
below.

In **Settings › Your data** you can also:

- **Export your data**: a JSON file with everything you wrote and recorded,
  handed to the iOS share sheet for you to keep or send wherever you want. The
  file is made on the device and only leaves it if you send it.
- **Delete your data**: removes from the device, at once, everything listed
  under "What you write and log" above. Your preferences (language,
  calendar, times) stay. It cannot be undone.

## Children

Missale is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect data from
anyone under 13. If you learn of an account created by a child, write to the
contact below and it will be deleted.

## Your rights (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD)

For the account data described above, **we are the controller**. The GDPR, CCPA
and LGPD give you rights of access, correction, deletion and portability over
it. You can delete the account at any time in the app, and ask for access,
correction or deletion through the contact below.

What you write and log does not stay with us: the text that passes through
the server for guidance and personalization is not kept, and everything else
stays under your own control, on your device, and goes with the app when you
delete it.

## Changes to this policy

If the app begins storing or sending anything different, this policy will be
updated before the version that does so reaches the App Store, and the date at
the top will change.
